# 这是一个学习笔记，伴随我从小白开始成长的辛路历程(This is a study notes. With me from small white began to grow up)

## 学习记录(Learning record)

- 从真正转码（2020.9）到现在2022.7入职某研究院，经历了两年时间今天完成这个REDEME来记录下自己的学习生活

- 我是一名JAVA程序员，在读大学期间，由于毕业设计等等不同的需求，所以学习了各种语言、框架等，学习过的知识虽然并没有全部记录在笔记中，但大部分还是会写入笔记中

- 从开始记录笔记从word文档格式，到从简的txt格式，到后来学习什么语言就用什么格式，以写注释的方式写笔记，再到后来接触到markdown，一个专门用来简化文档的记录笔记的格式，再到重视英语对程序员的重要性，开始尝试使用英文记录笔记，一点一点自己摸索，也象征着我对计算机和软件工程的理解

- 今后我仍然会不定时更新这份学习笔记

- I decided to finish this note today after two years of working in the computer industry from September 2020 to July 2022 when I joined a research institute

- I'm a JAVA coder. When I was in college, DUE to different needs such as graduation projects, I learned various languages and frameworks, etc. Although not all the knowledge I learned was recorded in my notes, most of it was still recorded in my notes

- From start recording notes from "word" document format, to simple "txt" format, and then learn what language use what format, write notes, in the form of written comments to the later comes into contact with the "markdown", a specially designed to simplify the document format to record notes, to pay attention to the importance of English for programmers, began to try to use English to record notes, It is also a symbol of my understanding of computer and software engineering

- I will update this study note from time to time
